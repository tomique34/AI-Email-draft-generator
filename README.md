## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for your chosen providers:
  - Sambanova API key
  - OpenAI API key (optional)
  - Anthropic API key (optional)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install openai streamlit python-dotenv anthropic
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with your API keys:
   ```bash
   SAMBANOVA_API_KEY=your_sambanova_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
   ```

## Environment Variables and API Key Management

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and update the Sambanova API key:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Required variable:
- `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY`: Your Sambanova AI API key (required in .env file)

For OpenAI and Anthropic API keys, we recommend using the Streamlit UI input field instead of environment variables for several reasons:

### Security Benefits
- API keys are not stored in configuration files
- Keys are only held in memory during the session
- Keys are not exposed in logs or container inspection
- No risk of accidentally committing API keys to version control

### Flexibility Advantages
- Switch between different API keys without restarting the application
- Use different API keys for different providers in the same session
- Test various configurations on the fly
- Easy key rotation and management

### Development/Production Consistency
- Same code works across all environments (local, container, production)
- No need to manage multiple .env files
- Simplified deployment process
- Consistent behavior across different setups

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_sambanova_emaildraft.py
   ```

2. The application will open in your default web browser.

3. In the sidebar:
   - Select your preferred LLM provider
   - Enter your API key (if not set in environment variables)
   - Select an AI model from the chosen provider
   - Adjust temperature (0.0-1.0)
   - Adjust top P value (0.0-1.0)

4. In the main area:
   - (Optional) Enter a system prompt to set context
   - Enter your email request in the user prompt field
   - Click "Generate Email" to create your draft

## Example Use Cases

- Follow-up emails for customer inquiries
- Thank you emails after meetings
- Product launch announcements
- Job application follow-ups
- Customer service responses
- Meeting scheduling emails

## Tips for Best Results

- Be specific in your prompts
- Use the system prompt to set the tone and style
- Choose the appropriate provider and model for your use case:
  - Sambanova models for high-performance local inference
  - GPT-4 for complex reasoning and professional writing
  - Claude-3 for detailed analysis and creative writing
- Adjust temperature:
  - Lower (0.1-0.3) for more focused, professional emails
  - Higher (0.7-0.9) for more creative variations

## Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Traefik reverse proxy running with `traefik-net` network
- Valid SSL certificate configured in Traefik for `your-domain.com`

### Local Build and Run
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t email-draft-generator .

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Configuration
The application is containerized and configured to run behind a Traefik reverse proxy with the following features:

- **Base URL**: `https://your-domain.com/email-draft-generator`
- **Container Port**: 8501 (Streamlit default)
- **Network**: Uses external `traefik-net` network
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY` (for Sambanova AI)
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for OpenAI)
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (for Anthropic)

### Traefik Integration
The service is configured with Traefik labels for:
- Automatic HTTPS routing
- Path-based routing with prefix stripping
- Secure TLS configuration
- Load balancing

### Deployment Steps
1. Ensure Traefik is running and `traefik-net` network exists:
   ```bash
   docker network ls | grep traefik-net
   ```

2. Create `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```bash
   SAMBANOVA_API_KEY=your_sambanova_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
   ```

3. Deploy the service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Verify deployment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

5. Access the application at `https://your-domain.com/email-draft-generator`

## Troubleshooting

- If you get API errors:
  - Verify your API keys in the `.env` file or sidebar input
  - Check that you have access to the selected model
  - Ensure you have sufficient API credits
- Ensure all dependencies are installed in your virtual environment
- Check that you're running the latest version of Python and required packages
